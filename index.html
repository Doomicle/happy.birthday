        <h2>These are some ones I'm managing for Juan at the moment:</h2>
        <p>I've taken a risk on a small cap coin which is looking a bit precarious at the moment, but I think it should recover by the looks of that crypto project. Normally it's best to stick with large capitalisation coins; Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Litecoin, etc.</p>

        <p>Sadly I have nowhere near as much money to put into your bots :..O( But hopefully it'll grow into this much. Who says money doesn't grow on trees.. It grows on blockchain database trees... That's good enough for me =OP</p>
